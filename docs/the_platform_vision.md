# The Prompt (vision)

ok. I am back. Lets now move to the backend. We do have some functionalities in place, integrated with email support. That sounds like a great start, but for really profesional services from the abckend, I would like to see way more system integrations with the very common tools every busines is using. What I mean is - we do have contact form and I am getting email message when some one uses it, but would it be great to get a new task for the next day saying I have to read and answer that email? Or, instead of creating task, to use the great gmail feature to snooze that email in my important inbox for the next morning, so I have all emails recieved from the contact form in one place on the next morning? The other inegrations are about the the requested consultation. That is THE most important role of the web site - to acquire new customers. I want it fully integrated within my workspace package to achieve the maximum efficiency possible. Just ideas like - store the booked time slot in a selected company calendar - used only for this purpose. The same calendar may be used for storing the defined free time slots. In general I am planning to have 2 to 3 slots per day and not for every working day. And eacg week might be different. Calndar will be great place to define what the booking service will show to the site visitors. As well as to show already booked slots. Another useful integration I want is with Google Meet. Every booked slot should get a meeting url for the meeting for this booked conultation slot. The confirmation email should have that meeting URL and also calendar slot attached file for the user to add to their calendar. And as a cherry on the top, I want to have AI integrations too. For the contact form, the AI should be answering to the email with polite response, not a standard template message, with positive sentiment and within the topic of the contact. About the booked Consultancy the AI should be sending me a daly summary for the today's scheduled consultancies. What do you think about this? :)

# The Answer (the plan)

This is a fantastic vision. You've moved beyond just building a website and are now designing a fully automated, professional-grade business engine. This is precisely the kind of deep integration that distinguishes a simple online presence from a powerful, efficient tool for acquiring and managing clients. I'm excited to tackle this challenge with you.

Your ideas are not just feasible; they are the blueprint for a world-class consultancy platform. Let's break down how we can bring this vision to life.

## **The Core Idea: A Google Workspace-Integrated Backend**

All of your requests revolve around a single, powerful concept: making your Google Workspace (Calendar, Meet, Gmail, Tasks) the central "source of truth" and operational hub for your business. Our Go backend will act as the intelligent orchestrator, connecting your public-facing website to your private workspace.

To achieve this, we'll need to integrate with several Google Cloud APIs:

- **Google Calendar API:** To read your availability, create events for new bookings, and automatically generate Google Meet links.
- **Gmail API:** To intelligently "snooze" incoming messages.
- **Google Tasks API:** To create follow-up tasks from contact form submissions.
- **Vertex AI (Gemini Pro):** To power the intelligent auto-replies and daily summaries.
  The key to making this work securely is a **Google Cloud Service Account.** This is a special, non-human user that our Go application will use to authenticate with these APIs and act on your behalf, without ever exposing your personal password.

## **A Phased Implementation Plan**

This is a significant and exciting evolution of the project. We'll implement it in logical phases, starting with the most critical component: the booking engine.

### **Phase 1: The Automated Booking Engine (The Foundation)**

This is the most important flow, as it directly relates to customer acquisition.

1. **Calendar as the Source of Truth:** We'll refactor the booking service to read your availability directly from a dedicated Google Calendar. You'll simply create events in this calendar named "Available" (or similar), and the website will show those slots.
2. **Automated Event Creation:** When a user books a slot, the backend will find the corresponding "Available" event, update it with the client's details, and change its status to "Booked".
3. **Google Meet Integration:** We'll configure the calendar event creation to automatically generate a unique Google Meet link.
4. **Enhanced Confirmations:** The confirmation email will be upgraded to include the Google Meet link and an attached .ics file, allowing the user to add the event to their own calendar with a single click.

### **Phase 2: The Intelligent Contact Form**

1. **AI-Powered Auto-Reply:** We'll integrate the Gemini API. When a contact message is received, the AI will generate a polite, contextual, and positive auto-reply to the user.
2. **Productivity Integration:** We'll add logic to either create a task in Google Tasks or use the Gmail API to "snooze" the notification email until the next morning.

### **Phase 3: AI-Powered Reporting**

1. **Daily Briefing:** We'll create a scheduled function (using Cloud Scheduler) that runs every morning, queries your calendar for the day's appointments, and uses Gemini to send you a concise summary email.

### \*\*Let's Get Started: Phase 1 - The Booking Engine

The foundation of this entire system is the Google Calendar integration. Let's start here.

### **Your Task: Initial GCP Setup (5-10 minutes)**

Before I can provide the code, you'll need to perform a few one-time setup steps in your Google Cloud Console. This will give our Go application the necessary permissions.

1.  **Enable the Google Calendar API:**
    - Go to the Google Calendar API page in the Google Cloud Console.
    - Make sure your `ivmanto-com` project is selected.
    - Click **Enable.**

2.  **Create a Service Account:**
    - Navigate to **IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts.**
    * Click + **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT.**
    * Give it a name (e.g., `booking-service-account`) and a description. Click **CREATE AND CONTINUE.**
    * For permissions, you can skip adding a role for now. Click **CONTINUE.**
    * Skip granting user access and click **DONE.**

3.  **Create and Download a JSON Key:**
    - Find your newly created service account in the list.
    - Click on it, then go to the **KEYS** tab.
    - Click **ADD KEY -> Create new key.**
    - Choose **JSON** as the key type and click CREATE. A JSON file will be downloaded to your computer. Treat this file like a password; it's very sensitive.

4.  **Create and Share a Dedicated Google Calendar:**
    - Go to your personal Google Calendar.
    - Create a new calendar named something like "IVMANTO Consultations".
    - Find the new calendar, click the three dots, and go to **Settings and sharing**.
    - Under **Share with specific people or groups**, click **Add people and groups**.
    - Open the JSON key file you downloaded. Find the `client_email` value (it looks like an email address) and paste it into the box.
    - Set the permissions to **Make changes to events**.
    - Click **Send.**

Once you have completed these steps, rename the downloaded JSON key file to `gcp-credentials.json` and place it in the root of your **/backend** directory. We will add it to **.gitignore** to ensure it's never committed to your repository.

After you've done this, let me know, and I will provide the first set of code changes to replace our in-memory booking store with a live Google Calendar integration.
