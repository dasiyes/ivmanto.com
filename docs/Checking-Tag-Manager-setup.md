Of course! I can certainly guide you on how to check if your Tag Manager is set up correctly. Since I can't access your account directly, I'll walk you through the exact steps that professionals use to audit and verify a Tag Manager implementation.

The most powerful tool for this is the Preview and Debug mode.

Step-by-Step Guide to Verify Your Tag Manager Setup
Here is a checklist you can follow to ensure everything is working as expected.

1. Verify the Container Snippet is Installed Correctly
   First, ensure the main Tag Manager code is on every page of your website.

Find your Snippet: In your Google Tag Manager account, your container ID looks like GTM-XXXXXXX. The installation instructions will show you two pieces of code.
Check your Website's Code:
Go to your website in a browser.
Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source".
Search (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) for your GTM container ID (e.g., GTM-XXXXXXX).
You should find two snippets:

A <script> block placed as high in the <head> of the page as possible.
A <noscript> block placed immediately after the opening <body> tag.
Here's what they typically look like:

html
Show full code block

<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXXX');</script>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->

html

<!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->

<noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXXX"
height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript>

<!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->

If you can't find these snippets, the Tag Manager is not installed, and no tags will fire.

2. Use Preview Mode for Live Debugging
   This is the most crucial step.

In your Google Tag Manager workspace, click the "Preview" button in the top right corner.
A new tab will open. Enter your website's URL and click "Connect".
Your website will open in a new window with a "Tag Assistant Connected" badge.
The "Tag Assistant" debug window (the tab you opened in step 2) will show a live event stream.

3. Test Your Tags, Triggers, and Variables
   Now, interact with your website as a user would and watch the Tag Assistant debug window.

Page Load: When the page first loads, you should see events like "Consent Initialization," "Initialization," "Container Loaded," and "DOM Ready." Click on "Container Loaded." On the right, you should see your pageview tags under the "Tags Fired" section. If a tag is under "Tags Not Fired," Tag Assistant will tell you which condition in its trigger was not met.

Button Clicks: Click on a button that is supposed to trigger an event.

In the debug window, a "Click" event should appear in the left-hand summary.
Click on that event. Did the correct tag fire?
If not, check the trigger conditions. For example, if your trigger is "Click URL contains '/contact-us'", did the button you clicked have that URL?
Form Submissions: Fill out and submit a test form.

A "Form Submit" event should appear.
Check if your form submission tag fired correctly.
Check Variables: When a tag fires, you need to ensure it's sending the correct data.

In the debug window, select the event that fired your tag (e.g., "Click").
Click on the "Variables" tab.
Review the values of the variables at that moment. For example, if you clicked a product, is the productName variable filled with the correct product's name? Is the clickText variable correct? 4. Check for Browser Console Errors
While you have your website open, open your browser's developer tools (press F12) and click on the "Console" tab. Look for any red error messages, especially those related to gtm.js or dataLayer. These can prevent Tag Manager from working correctly.

By following these steps, you can systematically test every part of your Tag Manager setup and pinpoint exactly where any issues might be. If a tag isn't firing, the Preview mode will almost always tell you why.

Let me know if you run into a specific issue while debugging!
