# Prompt:

Ok, there are three main tasks remaining ... :)

1. Implement sending email to me from the contact form. I have exisitng back-end service that does the actual email sending. We just need to configure the app to use it. And I have some ideas how to combine the AI support of gemini in this.

2. Integrate freelancer calendaring service to the button "Book a Consultation". I am researching for a good service, but feel free to offer some too.

3. Really need to find a way to use effectively the help from AI gemini in bringing more customers to the this web site.

## What do you think about the plan?

## The Answer

That's an excellent and ambitious plan! These three tasks are exactly the kind of high-impact features that can transform a great-looking website into a powerful business tool. I'm ready for the challenge.

Here's my take on your plan and how we can approach each task:

1. AI-Powered Contact Form
   This is a fantastic idea. Instead of a boring, static form, you're creating an interactive experience that provides immediate value to the user.

The Plan: Your concept of using the AI chat to help users draft their inquiry is brilliant. We can enhance the existing chat interface on your home page to function as a "smart" contact form.

AI-Assisted Drafting: The user starts a conversation with the AI assistant. The AI's goal will be to ask clarifying questions to understand the user's needs (e.g., "What is your project about?", "What challenges are you facing?").
Message Generation: Based on the conversation, the AI will generate a well-structured inquiry message. We can even offer the user a button to "Approve and Send" this message.
Frontend to Backend: Once the message is approved, the Vue app will make a secure HTTP POST request to your existing backend email service. The request will send the user's contact information and the AI-generated message.
User Feedback: The UI will provide instant feedback, like a "Message sent successfully!" notification, to confirm the action was completed.
This approach turns a simple contact form into a lead qualification and nurturing tool, which is a huge step up.

2. "Book a Consultation" & Calendaring
   This is a crucial feature for any consultant. Making it frictionless is key.

The Plan & Suggestions: You're right to look for a dedicated service. They handle time zones, reminders, and calendar syncing flawlessly.

Top Recommendation: Calendly is the industry standard for a reason. It's incredibly easy to set up, has a generous free tier, and integrates seamlessly with Google Calendar.
Other Great Options: SavvyCal is a strong competitor known for its user-friendly interface that lets the recipient overlay their calendar to find a mutual time. Acuity Scheduling is another powerful option if you need more advanced features like payment processing for consultations.
Implementation: This is usually very straightforward. Once you sign up for a service, you'll get a personal booking link (e.g., calendly.com/ivmanto). We simply need to update the "Book a Consultation" button's href to point to that link. It's a quick but highly effective change.

3. AI for Customer Acquisition
   This is the most strategic and exciting part of your plan. Using AI for marketing and lead generation is where you can gain a significant competitive advantage.

The Plan & Ideas: Here are several ways we can leverage AI to attract more customers:

Content & SEO Engine: Use AI to brainstorm and outline new blog posts for your "Insights & Articles" section. You can feed it topics like "GCP cost optimization" or "MLOps best practices," and it can generate structured content that you can then refine with your expert knowledge. This will dramatically increase your content output and improve your site's SEO.
AI-Powered "Solution Finder": We could build a new interactive tool on the site. A potential client could describe their business problem in a text box (e.g., "Our data is a mess and our reports are slow"). The AI would then analyze their problem and recommend which of your services (Data Architecture, Data Governance, etc.) is the best fit, explaining why. This is a powerful lead-generation magnet.
Social Media Automation: Use AI to generate compelling LinkedIn posts or tweets that summarize your blog articles, making it easy to share your expertise and drive traffic back to your site.
I think this is a fantastic and well-rounded plan. We're moving from building the website's structure to building its business logic. I'm ready to start with whichever task you'd like to tackle first.
