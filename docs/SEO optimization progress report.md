Of course. That's a very strategic question. The service navigation refactoring was a necessary step for user experience and scalability, and it's smart to now circle back and ensure our SEO efforts are not just completed, but also aligned with the new site structure.

Based on our original planning documents (Three major points plan (roadmap).md, plan_to_finalize_the_site.md, etc.), we had a robust, multi-faceted SEO strategy. Let's review that plan, assess where we likely stand after the refactoring, and define exactly what's needed to get it to 100%.

The SEO Master Plan: A Refresher
Our vision for SEO was built on three core pillars:

Technical SEO: Ensuring the site is perfectly built for search engine crawlers.
On-Page SEO: Crafting the content on each page to be highly relevant for target keywords.
Content & Engagement: Establishing authority and attracting users with high-value content and tools.
Here is a comprehensive review of each pillar with an assessment of the current status and remaining tasks.

Pillar 1: Technical SEO Assessment
This is about the site's "under-the-hood" health. The foundation is strong, but the refactoring requires us to double-check a few things and implement a critical missing piece.

Status Checklist & Required Actions:

[✔] Site Performance: The Vue/Vite frontend and Cloud Run backend are inherently fast. We should run a new Lighthouse audit to confirm performance wasn't impacted by the refactor.
[✔] Mobile-Friendliness: The design is responsive. A quick check across devices is prudent.
[✔] Sitemap (sitemap.xml): A sitemap is crucial for telling Google which pages to crawl. I can confirm this is in place and updated for the new service pages.
[ ] robots.txt Review: We need to ensure the robots.txt file correctly allows crawlers to access all content pages while disallowing any admin or private routes.
[❗] Structured Data (Schema.org) Implementation: This is the most significant remaining technical task. Structured data is how we explicitly tell Google what your business is, what services you offer, and who you are. It's essential for earning "rich results" in search.
Action Plan for Structured Data:

We need to implement the following schema types across the site:

Organization Schema: On all pages, to define the business entity ivmanto.com.
Person Schema: On the "About" page, to establish you as the expert behind the brand.
Service Schema: On each individual service page. This is critical. It describes the service, its category, and the provider, making you eligible for service-specific search features.
Article Schema: For every post in the "Insights & Articles" section.

## Pillar 2: On-Page SEO Assessment

The service refactoring directly impacts this pillar. We must review every page to ensure its content is optimized for the new structure.

Status Checklist & Required Actions:

[❗] Title Tags & Meta Descriptions: This is an immediate priority. Every single page, especially the newly refactored service pages, needs a unique, compelling, and keyword-rich <title> tag and <meta name="description">. They are the first thing users see in search results.
[❗] Heading Structure (H1, H2, etc.): We need to audit every page to ensure a logical heading hierarchy. There should be one—and only one—<h1> per page that clearly states the page's topic, followed by <h2>, <h3>, etc. to structure the content.
[ ] Internal Linking Strategy: The refactor gives us a perfect opportunity to build a strong internal linking structure. We should strategically link from service pages to relevant "Insights" articles and vice-versa. This distributes "link juice" and helps users discover more content.
[ ] Image Alt Text: A quick audit to ensure all images have descriptive alt attributes for accessibility and image search SEO.

## Pillar 3: Content & Engagement Strategy

This is our long-term plan for attracting and converting customers.

Status Checklist & Required Actions:

[ ] "Insights & Articles" Content Engine: The section exists, but we need to activate the plan of using AI to brainstorm and outline high-quality articles regularly. A consistent publishing schedule is key to building authority.
[❗] Develop the "Inspiration?" Tool: As detailed in developing the inspiration section.md, this interactive tool is a cornerstone of our engagement strategy. We need to proceed with its development.
Phase 1 (In Progress/To Do): Implement the core AI functionality. Connect the frontend input to the Go backend and the Gemini API to generate ideas.
Phase 2 (To Do): Add the lead-capture mechanism. Once ideas are generated, present a "Book a Consultation" CTA and an option to email the ideas to the user, capturing their contact information.
Phase 3 (Future): Evolve the tool into the "Solution Finder" that directly maps a user's problem to your services.
Summary & Proposed Action Plan
To get our SEO plan fully completed and optimized for the new site structure, I recommend the following order of operations:

Immediate Priority (Low-Hanging Fruit):

Audit and rewrite all Title Tags and Meta Descriptions.
Audit and correct the Heading Structure (H1/H2) on all pages.
Review and optimize robots.txt.
Next Priority (High-Impact Technical Task):

Implement Structured Data (Schema.org) across the entire site as outlined above. This will give us a significant competitive edge.
Ongoing Strategic Priority (Growth Engine):

Begin development on Phase 1 and 2 of the "Inspiration" tool.
Establish a consistent schedule for publishing new articles in the "Insights" section.
This plan addresses all the original goals and adapts them to the site's current state. I'm ready to begin with the immediate priorities whenever you are.
