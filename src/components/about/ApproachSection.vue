            I am a firm believer of the philosophy of
            <strong>"Organic Architecture"</strong> defined by the famous architect Frank Lloyd
            Wright. His list of best practicies is a comprehensive guide to best practices for
            "architecting" in general, including Cloud Architecture.

            His work and philosophy promoted a set of core principles that he considered essential
            for creating meaningful and enduring architecture. Integration with Nature: This is the
            most crucial tenet. Wright believed a building should appear to grow from its site,
            using local materials and horizontal lines that mimic the landscape. He sought to blur
            the lines between inside and outside. Form and Function are One: Wright famously adapted
            his mentor Louis Sullivan's phrase, "form follows function," to "form and function are
            one, joined in a spiritual union." He believed that a building's design, its materials,
            and its purpose should be inextricably linked. Simplicity and Repose: Wright championed
            simplicity, arguing that it was the quality that measured the true value of any work of
            art. He believed that a good design should be straightforward and unadorned, allowing
            the materials and the space itself to speak. The Human Element: For Wright, architecture
            was a human endeavor. He believed that buildings should serve the people who inhabit
            them, focusing on comfort, utility, and the enrichment of life. He often designed the
            furniture, lighting, and even the dishes for his homes, ensuring a unified,
            human-centered experience. Integrity of Materials: He believed in using materials
            honestly, allowing the natural character of stone, wood, and concrete to be visible
            rather than covering them up. He felt that each material had its own integrity and
            beauty that should be celebrated.
