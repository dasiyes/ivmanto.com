    <h1>The Future of Web Development</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Exploring the upcoming trends in web development, from serverless architectures to the rise of
      WebAssembly. What skills will be most in demand?
    </p>
    <p>
      The web development landscape is in a constant state of flux. New frameworks, libraries, and
      paradigms emerge at a dizzying pace. Staying ahead of the curve is crucial for any developer
      looking to build modern, efficient, and scalable web applications.
    </p>
    <h2>Serverless and Edge Computing</h2>
    <p>
      Serverless architecture continues to gain momentum. By abstracting away server management,
      developers can focus purely on writing code. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud
      Functions, and Vercel Functions allow for incredible scalability and cost-efficiency. Coupled
      with edge computing, which runs code closer to the user, we're seeing faster and more
      responsive applications than ever before.
    </p>
    <h2>WebAssembly (WASM)</h2>
    <p>
      WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. WASM is designed
      as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for
      client and server applications. It allows developers to run high-performance code written in
      languages like C++, Rust, and Go directly in the browser, opening up new possibilities for
      web-based gaming, video editing, and scientific computing.
    </p>
    <h2>The Rise of Meta-Frameworks</h2>
    <p>
      Frameworks like Next.js (for React) and Nuxt (for Vue) are becoming the standard for building
      production-grade applications. These "meta-frameworks" provide a robust set of features out of
      the box, including server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-based
      routing, and API routes. They solve many of the common problems associated with building
      complex single-page applications.
