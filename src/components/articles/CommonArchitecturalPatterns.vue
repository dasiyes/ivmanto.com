  <p>
    The web development landscape is in a constant state of flux. New frameworks, libraries, and
    paradigms emerge at a dizzying pace. Staying ahead of the curve is crucial for any developer
    looking to build modern, efficient, and scalable web applications.
  </p>
  <h2>Serverless and Edge Computing</h2>
  <p>
    Serverless architecture continues to gain momentum. By abstracting away server management,
    developers can focus purely on writing code. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions,
    and Vercel Functions allow for incredible scalability and cost-efficiency. Coupled with edge
    computing, which runs code closer to the user, we're seeing faster and more responsive
    applications than ever before.
  </p>
  <h2>WebAssembly (WASM)</h2>
  <p>
    WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. WASM is designed
    as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for
    client and server applications. It allows developers to run high-performance code written in
    languages like C++, Rust, and Go directly in the browser, opening up new possibilities for
    web-based gaming, video editing, and scientific computing.
  </p>
  <h2>The Rise of Meta-Frameworks</h2>
  <p>
    Frameworks like Next.js (for React) and Nuxt (for Vue) are becoming the standard for building
    production-grade applications. These "meta-frameworks" provide a robust set of features out of
    the box, including server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-based
    routing, and API routes. They solve many of the common problems associated with building complex
    single-page applications.
