      There are two dimensions that matter most to the people <strong>time</strong> and
      <strong>location</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The digitalisation has changed how we perceive both in our lives. Imagine you live in ’30 of past century. The main source for the news you receive is the newspaper and in exceptional cases, you get a telegram. You wait for the news and you get them at the time when the postman comes. In most cases on one of the places you usually go — home, office or etc.</p>
    <p>The digitalisation has changed that. Slowly with the time, we have reached the point where we select the news that we want, at the time we want to get it. This the most simple explanation and I would agree with anyone who will object it. The whole story is much more complicated.</p>
    <p>
        But this is not the point to explain the digitalisation and its technology. The master question here I have ( for myself) is why this has happened? </br>
        Have you ever heard “Go faster! Go further!”? Isn’t that the main reason?
    </p>
    <p>Now everyone can make its own projection of today towards the future and follow the same pattern to see where out tomorrow is heading to. :)</p>
